### MetFrag Web
<a class="btn btn-primary" href="http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/MetFragBeta" role="button">MetFrag Web tool</a> 
<hr>

The new web tool of MetFrag uses a new fragmentation algorithm which allows faster and more efficient processing of the compounds. It has additional fields for setting parameters that depend on your experimental conditions during the MS acquisition. At first the parameters for the candidate database query have to be defined under <span style="border-bottom: 1px black dotted;">Database Settings</span>. The candidate database has to be selected which can be queried either by a monoisotopic mass, a molecular formula or comma separated database dependent identifiers. The first has to be defined together with a mass deviation in ppm. A variaty of databases can be selected including PubChem, KEGG, ChEBI and a derivatised version of the KEGG database generated by in silico TMS (trimethylsilylation) and MeOx (methoximation) derivatization.

After setting the parameters for the database query the "Retrieve Candidates" button can be pushed to submit the database query.

After a short processing time the number of candidates found in the database with the defined filter criteria is displayed.

Then the parameters for MetFrag processing have to be defined under the <span style="border-bottom: 1px black dotted;">Fragmentation Settings & Processing</span>. This includes the adduct type of the precursor ion. Based on this fragment massed will be calculated. Additionally, the a relative and absolute mass deviation has to be defined with which <span style="font-style: italic;">in silico</span> generated fragments will be mapped to the experimental data defined in the "MS/MS Peak list" text field. After all parameters are defined correctly, the button "Process Candidates" has to be pushed to start the processing.<br> 
MetFrag then starts the <span style="font-style: italic;">in silico</span> fragmentation, the mapping of the fragments to the given mass peaks and the scoring for each retrieved
candidates. Finally, the score ranked list of candidates will be displayed after the processing has finshed successfully. Each row in this list includes the candidate image, identifier (database link), exact mass, molecualr formula, score and number of explained together with more details about fragments and scores for each candiate.
