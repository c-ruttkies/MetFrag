### Overview

MetFrag is a freely available software for the annotaion of high precision tandem mass spectra of metabolites which 
is a first and critical step for the identification of a molecule's structure. Candidate molecules 
of different databases are fragmented in silico and matched against mass to charge values. A score calculated
using the fragment peak matches gives hints to the quality of the candidate spectrum assignment.

### Availability

MetFrag can be easily used via the <a href="/MetFrag/projects/metfragweb">web tool</a>. For high-troughput data processing the <a href="/MetFrag/projects/commandline">commandline version</a> should be most convenient as well
as the <a href="/MetFrag/projects/metfragr">R-package</a> for users versed in the R programming language.

### License
